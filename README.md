Attempting my first ever plasmid design.

## The Plan

I want a visible-light green to complement the [set of chromoproteins](https://atinygreencell.com/products/rainbow-chromoprotein-expression-plasmid-set) I've bought. The plan is as follows:

- Practise some sterile technique on some basic experiments
- Get a gene transformation kit (I've ordered one from Carolina bio) that is made to let students transform bacteria. This will 1) serve as practice with a known-good polasmid and 2) fill a few small gaps in what I have on hand for doing transformations
- Attempt a transformation with the plasmid described in this repo
- If it works and it looks cool, share it around!
- Make some dope agar art

## Current Status

I came up with what I thought was a clever idea, but alas I made a mistake that means it probably wouldn't work. This repo will be updated once I finish up v2.
