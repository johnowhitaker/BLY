# BLY

Attempting to make a green protein! I've designed and ordered a plasmid for it. This repo has my process, the relevant DNA bits, and will house results once I get it and try to get it into something living :)

The notebook ('BLY_Designing_The_Plasmid.ipynb') documents the construction of a casette containing the core protein sequence (which consists of aeBlue and fwYellow proteins joined with a flexible linker) along with a promoter, terminator, RBS and some other bits. This casette goes in a GenScript pUC57-kan flash gene vector (pictured above) - but I included NcoI and SacI sites so that hopefully interested parties could snip it out and pop it into their vector of choice? (TBH these were a last-minute addition).

I've added the files from GenScript ('Fasta_Final U700D316G0.txt' and '2_bly_op2_p06_pUC57-Kan.gb') as well as an annotated version of the latter ('BLY_pUC57-Kan_Annotated.dna', pictured above) from snapgene.
